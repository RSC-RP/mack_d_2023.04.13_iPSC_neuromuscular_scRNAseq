The goal of mack_d_2023.04.13_iPSC_neuromuscular_scRNAseq is to investigate a longitudinal single-cell RNAseq dataset with the differentiation motor neurons from iPSCs. The gene expression was assayed using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics) at each timepoint. We collected cells from undifferentiated iPSC, day3 of differentiation, day5, day8â€¦ until day 45. 

We aim to identify the regional identity and subtypes of iPSC motor neurons and transcriptomic (dis)similarity with native MNs in the fetal spinal cord.
